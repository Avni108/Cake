1) Take the packets of oreo and dump them in your bowl.
2) Then mash them and add milk in them while mashing to make it easier!
3) Take another bowl and spread oil in the sides nicely so that while removing the cake it does not stick in the bowl.
4) Now take the paste of oreo and milk and put it in the other bowl in which you have spread oil.
5) Then heat the cake in microwave for about 2-3 minutes or even 4 minutes sometimes if the paste is a lot in quantity.
